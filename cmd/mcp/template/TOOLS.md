Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- SSH hosts and aliases
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.
