# MCP

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** connects Memoh bots to external tool services.

## What MCP Adds

- Standardized tool discovery and invocation
- Remote capability extension without changing core bot code
- Per-bot integration flexibility

Memoh supports MCP connections so bots can access external systems through a unified protocol.

## Why It Matters

MCP makes capability extension modular. You can add or swap tool backends with minimal coupling.

## Web UI Path

- `Bots > Select a bot > MCP`
