# Memory

**Memory** is Memoh's long-term knowledge system for each bot.

## How It Works

- Important facts are extracted from conversations
- Memories are stored and indexed
- Relevant memories are retrieved by semantic similarity when needed

Memoh combines vector retrieval with keyword-style retrieval for better recall and precision.

## Why It Matters

Memory enables continuity across long timelines, so bots can maintain context beyond short prompt windows.

## Web UI Path

- `Bots > Select a bot > Memory`
