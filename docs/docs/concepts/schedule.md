# Schedule

A **schedule** is a cron-based automation rule that runs bot commands at defined times.

## Core Fields

- `pattern`: cron expression
- `command`: command or task to execute
- `enabled`: whether the schedule is active
- `max_calls`: optional execution cap
- `current_calls`: current run count

## Why It Matters

Schedules make bots proactive, not only reactive.  
You can automate recurring operations like summaries, reminders, checks, and maintenance tasks.

## Web UI Path

- `Not available in current Web UI`

> Schedule is supported by backend and CLI/API, but there is currently no dedicated schedule page in the Web UI.
