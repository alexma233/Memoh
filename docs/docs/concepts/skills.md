# Skills

**Skills** are reusable capability instructions that guide how a bot (or subagent) solves specific classes of tasks.

## Typical Skill Content

- Scope and purpose
- Input expectations
- Execution steps
- Constraints and output format

## Why It Matters

Skills help keep behavior consistent, reduce prompt duplication, and make complex workflows easier to maintain.

## Web UI Path

- `Bots > Select a bot > Subagents`

> Skills are currently primarily managed through agent/workspace configuration and runtime conventions, while subagent-related behavior is visible from the Subagents area.
