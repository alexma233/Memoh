# Subagents

**Subagents** are specialized helper agents that a bot can delegate tasks to.

## Core Idea

- The main bot acts as coordinator
- Subagents focus on narrower tasks
- Results are combined back into the main workflow

This supports decomposition of complex requests into smaller, more reliable execution units.

## Why It Matters

Subagent architecture improves scalability for multi-step tasks and helps separate responsibilities by role.

## Web UI Path

- `Bots > Select a bot > Subagents`
